In preparation for class, please read _OSTEP_ chapters 39 [Files and Directories][ostep-c39] and 40 [File System Implementation][ostep-c40]. Then, skim through the man pages for `ln` and `stat`. Test your understanding by writing pseudocode for an implementation of a simplified `find` program.

When you're ready, follow the instructions below to write a simple novelty filesystem using FUSE.
